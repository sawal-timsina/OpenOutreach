"""Per-launch email-setup nudge.

Runs every `rundaemon` start after onboarding. Until both a finder key and a
working mailbox exist, it prompts (on a TTY) or logs (headless) the next setup
step — copy drawn from the GLF angle in marketing/email-sequence.md, filled with
the user's own pipeline numbers. Never blocks: email is a deferrable upgrade.
